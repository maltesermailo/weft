//! §16 WEFT-RT voice — the `VoiceBackend` port (the pluggable-SFU seam).
//!
//! Signaling authority stays in weft-core (caps precede side effects,
//! invariant 4): a `VOICE JOIN` is checked against `listen`/`speak` caps +
//! channel membership + the M7 mute/ban deny-list *here*, and only then handed
//! to the backend to allocate an SFU slot. The backend — the reference
//! `WebrtcSfu` in `weft-rt`, or a future LiveKit adapter — owns the UDP socket
//! and the WebRTC negotiation; it never interprets caps. weftd installs one via
//! [`ServerCtx::set_voice_backend`](crate::ServerCtx::set_voice_backend); a
//! server with none advertises no `features=voice` and answers voice verbs with
//! `UNSUPPORTED`.
